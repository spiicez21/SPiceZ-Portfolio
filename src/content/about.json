        "I'm a Computer Science student driven by the thrill of building things that live on the internet. My journey started with a simple curiosity about how pixels move on a screen, and it has evolved into a full-blown obsession with crafting robust, scalable web applications.",
        "When I'm not debugging code at 3 AM or deep-diving into the latest frontend frameworks, you'll find me designing sleek graphics for clients or competing in high-intensity hackathons. I thrive in environments where engineering meets creativity.",
        "I believe in learning by doing, breaking things to understand them, and that the best code is written with good coffee and great music. Whether it's optimizing backend performance or perfecting a micro-interaction, I'm always chasing that next level of polish."
